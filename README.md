# ModSupportScript
It's just a joke language somebody said didn't exist till now.

## Syntax
It's a brainfuck wrapper. The syntax is basically the same as brainfuck, but even more verbose. Thank me because it's at least turing complete.  
  
`Hey mod, can you turn up the volume?` ... basically the same as brainfuck `+`  
`Hey mod, can you turn down the volume?` ... `-`  
`Hey mod, can you give me a rank pleeeeaze?` ... `>`  
`Hey mod, please ban this guy!` ... `<`  
`Hey mod, can you please give me the invite link?` ... `.`  
`Hey mod, did you get my mod application?` ... `,`  
`Hey mod, I have a new channel request!` ... `[`  
`Hey mod, can you delete this channel? It's dead!` ... `]`
